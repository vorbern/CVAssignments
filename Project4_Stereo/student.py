    Prepare normalized patch vectors according to normalized cross

    This is a preprocessing step for the NCC pipeline.  It is expected that
    'preprocess_ncc' is called on every input image to preprocess the NCC
    vectors and then 'compute_ncc' is called to compute the dot product
    between these vectors in two images.

    NCC preprocessing has two steps.
    (1) Compute and subtract the mean.
    (2) Normalize the vector.

    The mean is per channel.  i.e. For an RGB image, over the ncc_size**2
    patch, compute the R, G, and B means separately.  The normalization
    is over all channels.  i.e. For an RGB image, after subtracting out the
    RGB mean, compute the norm over the entire (ncc_size**2 * channels)
    vector and divide.

    If the norm of the vector is < 1e-6, then set the entire vector for that
    patch to zero.

    Patches that extend past the boundary of the input image at all should be
    considered zero.  Their entire vector should be set to 0.

    Patches are to be flattened into vectors with the default numpy row
    major order.  For example, given the following
    2 (height) x 2 (width) x 2 (channels) patch, here is how the output
    vector should be arranged.

    x: ( height, width, 3)

            else, fill row in b with depth_weight*depth[k] and fill column k of the corresponding
                row in A with depth_weight.

        Justification: 
            Since all the elements except k in a row is zero, this reduces to 
                depth_weight*x[k] = depth_weight*depth[k]
            you may see that, solving this will give x with values exactly same as the depths, 
            at pixels where alpha is non-zero, then why do we need 'depth_weight' in A and b?
            The answer to this will become clear when this will be reused in 'both' mode

    Note: The normals in image are +ve when they are along an +x,+y,-z axes, if seen from camera's viewpoint.
    If mode is 'normals':
        > Each row in A and b corresponds to an equation of relationship between adjacent pixels
        > For each pixel k and its immideate neighbour along x-axis l
            if any of the pixel k or pixel l has alpha value zero do not add any new equation.
            else, fill row in b with nx[k] (nx is x-component of normal), fill column k of the corresponding
                row in A with -nz[k] and column k+1 with value nz[k]
        > Repeat the above along the y-axis as well, except nx[k] should be -ny[k].

        Justification: Assuming the depth to be smooth and almost planar within one pixel width.
        The normal projected in xz-plane at pixel k is perpendicular to tangent of surface in xz-plane.
        In other word if n = (nx,ny,-nz), its projection in xz-plane is (nx,nz) and if tangent t = (tx,0,tz),
            then n.t = 0, therefore nx/-nz = -tz/tx
        Therefore the depth change with change of one pixel width along x axis should be proporational to tz/tx = -nx/nz
        In other words (depth[k+1]-depth[k])*nz[k] = nx[k]
        This is exactly what the equation above represents.
        The negative sign in ny[k] is because the indexing along the y-axis is opposite of +y direction.

    If mode is 'both':
        > Do both of the above steps.

        Justification: The depth will provide a crude estimate of the actual depth. The normals do the smoothing of depth map
        This is why 'depth_weight' was used above in 'depth' mode. 
            If the 'depth_weight' is very large, we are going to give preference to input depth map.
            If the 'depth_weight' is close to zero, we are going to give preference normals.
